# F-PKI Evaluation
We evaluated Flexible Public-Key Infrastructure (F-PKI) using a custom-built test system to assess how well it works in real-world scenarios. We develop a test system that automatically accesses a diverse set of websites from various locations. 

# Test System
The test system was developed to simulate real-world web browsing scenarios. The system automatically accessed a diverse set of multiple websites from 59 different countries, considering geographical variability. We integrated the NordVPN service to ensure accurate representation of browsing from different locations. It is also possible to integrate an F-PKI browser extension into the test system, which fetches website certificates from the F-PKI map server.
